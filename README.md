odoo-Talend-Component
========================

Input and Output Component for Talend Open Studio (Dataintegration)

Recently we were looking for Talend odoo (formerly known as OpenERP) components but soon discovered that there aren't any.

As a result we developed two new community components:

tOpenERPInput for reading objects
tOpenERPOutput for object creation, updates and object deletion

An example Talend Job (Version 5.3) is included. Just create a new Talend-Job and use File/Import.

Further information and an instruction about the use of the properties of the components can be found at our blog:

Thanks to the creators of the OpenERP Java API which we used as core library to communicate with OpenERP
